		<h1>Terminal Brief Summary</h1>
		<p>First terminal command we are going to learn is <samp>ls</samp>. This command can be run with or without arguments. You may run this command and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to see output, which varies by the arguments passed with &quot;-&quot; flag.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><samp>ls</samp> &mdash; lists all contents in the folder inline.</li>
			<li><samp>ls -al</samp> &mdash; list all contents in the folder, but for each file/folder in new line. Output also  includes dot (ex. .git/.gitignore/.vimrc) and hidden (ex. .DS_Store) files with permissions levels, dates.</li>
			<li><samp>ls -sl</samp> &mdash; list all contents in the folder, but for each file/fo    lder in new line. Output includes permission levels, file sizes and dates.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Second command is to create empty file/folder. Terminal commands to create and remove folder are <samp>mkdir</samp> and <samp>rmdir</samp> respectively. Examples:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><samp>mkdir ~/Downloads/Test</samp> &mdash; creates empty folder &quot;Test&quot; in &quot;Downloads&quot; folder.</li>
			<li><samp>rmdir ~/Downloads/Test</samp> &mdash; removes folder &quot;Test&quot; from &quot;Downloads&quot; folder.</li>
		</ul>.
		<p>Third group of commands is to manipulate files, their contents, locations, etc.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><samp>touch ~/Desktop/test.txt</samp> &mdash; creates empty file in Desktop folder.</li>
			<li><samp>echo &quot;Something&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/Desktop/text.txt</samp> &mdash; writes word &quot;something&quot; in the file test.txt.</li>
		</ul>
