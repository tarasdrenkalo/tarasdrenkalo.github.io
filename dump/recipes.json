        "Description": "Syrnyky is one of favourites of my family. My mother has cooked them several times. Syrnyky look like mini versions of cheesecakes, but they are made with natural cottage cheese that was the result of oxidation of whole milk. Many years ago, my grandmother had been cooking them in large batches of up to 20–30 servings each. This meal was and is part of our kitchen in Ukraine and here. Even though my mother no longer cooks, she occasionally makes them for us exclusively. Be prepared—this recipe is more complex than it seems.",
